# Poker Probabilities
Driven by a desire to develop a statistical mental framework in late night online poker sessions, I thought it may be fun to create a probability calculator for the game. This code's desired state is to allow the user to input their hand and current board, so the calculator can return the probabilities of getting a pair, two_pair, straight, flush, etc. The challenge here is to understand different combinations and permutations of possible hands, given current inputs, to then code up the functions to calculate probabilities.
Unfortunately, this project remains unfinished, where all the wrapper classes are generated, but only the flush calculation is coded. 

Challenges faced include:
- Figuring out how to verify whether my maths is correct
- Evaluating which combinations/permutations are needed for each hand possibility
